# vbscore
this web app is a javascript/css learning experiment
value is that I've never found an ios app with the ability to switch between rally and sideout scoring

Key features:
- side out scoring (used in beach and grass)
   - in both rally and side out scoring the score and name of the serving team is underlined
   - underline helps tracking when game has side out over and over again - let's face it sometimes you forget who served the last play
- switches between portrait and landscape mode based on screen size (on mobile will resize on rotate)
- allows switching sides to you match actual side switching on court
- pop out menu
- team name changes
- persistant variable memory survives browser reload

Thank you SHogan2 for adding all these features!
